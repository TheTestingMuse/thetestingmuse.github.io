## Recruiters, Please Read!
As a hiring manager of both individual contributors and managers, and having built-up stellar teams in my career, I know that hiring good people is *hard*. This section is designed to help you decide whether I might be a good fit for a role before you get in touch to discuss further.

While I am not actively looking for a new position, I will always listen to sensible ideas for my career growth, so here are a few points to consider before contacting me about a possible move:

- I need to _feel like I'm truly making a difference_ in my role.
- Any role should be _close to 100% remote_, with any non-remote elements commutable from Kent to London.
- I am not interested in contracts, nor freelance positions - _Permanent roles only please_.
- I'm a _"hands-off" engineering leader_, with a specialisation in quality and testing.
- Please provide a full _job description_ **and** _salary range_ for the position.
- Like most people, I am _not willing to change roles for a lower base salary_ than my current one.
- Perks, healthcare, bonuses etc are "nice to have" but don't factor into my decision-making.

**TL;DR - Ideal roles need to be making a difference, 100% Remote, permanent, hands-off, and the same or higher salary.**

If that marries up with your role, then please get in touch (david@ and then this domain name) and we can make some time to discuss further.

Thanks! :)

## Core Values
I try to stick to a core set of Values that drive each decision I make.

They are a reminder of the person I am, at my core, and they help me to work toward being the best I can be for my family, my friends, my career, my team at work, and of course myself.

My Core Values are:

* Lead by example
* Be someone's muse
* Be honest, open, & relatable
* Be effortlessly efficient
* Be passionate
* Be graciously disruptive

## Who Am I?
I'm a 44 year old husband, and father of two amazing kids. I live in Kent, in the United Kingdom.

I'm an award-winning international conference speaker, and also¬†a [Mental Health First Aid](https://mhfaengland.org/) practitioner.

I spent a short while hosting the London [Ministry of Testing ‚ÄúEssentials‚Äù](https://www.meetup.com/Ministry-of-Testing-London/events/) event in London in 2020 ‚Äì I **love** to share my experience and knowledge with people to help them be the best version of themselves.

During my [19 years](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thetestingmuse/) in the field of engineering, quality and testing I've been a tester, senior, lead, QE manager, head of testing and a cross-functional engineering manager.

I have a technical mindset and a real passion for investigation and testing as a profession (especially risk-based, and Exploratory Testing with developer tools, proxies, and API's). I've been told that my passion is infectious when talking about my experiences and perspectives on the subject.

Until recently I was a prolific [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheTestingMuse) and [Slack](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/slack_invite) user, plus testing community advocate. I'm in the process of resurrecting my [blog](/blog/), having taken a temporary step back over the last few months due to work commitments.

## Speaking
I may well be a veteran software tester, and given quite a few Lightning Talks at ~300 attendee conferences, but 2018 was the year that I felt my public speaking was up to the high standard expected of international conferences, and when I began sharing my experiences in earnest.

The following are conferences I have, or will be speaking at in the near future:

Let's Test South Africa (Nov 2018)
For my first ever full-length conference speaking slot, I was flown to Johannesburg, South Africa to talk about my own experiences with a decline in Mental Health.

Test Bash Brighton (Apr 2019)
I travelled down to Brighton, UK to share my Mental Health in Testing talk.
TestBash Brighton was the first conference I ever attended, back in 2015 so it was an honour to have been asked to speak there. [Sign-up FREE to see my talk](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/series/it-s-ok-testbash-talks-mental-health/lessons/mental-health-as-a-tester-david-williams)

Romanian Testing Conference (Jun 2019)
I was flown to Romania to talk about my experience with Mental Health in Testing, during my first ever visit to Romania.
All conference talks were voted-on by delegates, and my talk was awarded the conference's prized accolade of the People's Choice Award for the impact it made.

<insert Pandemic here>

Test Bash Careers (May 2022)
In the amazing British Airways i360 building I shared my talk, "The Most 'Valuable' Talk Ever?", centred around looking at the value of the work we do, how we track value and talk about it to progress in our careers and in our jobs. I talked about how I've used the concept of value throughout my career, and how value is applicable on both sides of the interview table.

## Blogging
Many moons ago I had a regular and full blog, however through life becoming manic in general I allowed it to become a *Legacy* product.

Now that time is a little more sparing, I will be reinstating my blog and re-adding some of the historical blog posts over time, along with adding some new thoughts and ideas I have.

## Positivity
 I little while ago I blogged on Medium about the mental health benefit with keeping a book of positive feedback, and using that book to remind yourself of the good work you do on a daily basis.

The following Testimonials are taken from my own **Personal Book of Positivity**:

Matthew Broadley
Event Organiser @ Let's Test

> ‚ÄúI now prefer @TheTestingMuse's example of a fish tank, where all the filters run at once, all the time ‚Äì It really represents how I test, since I work in continuously deployed systems. I love the parity between the different aspects of testing and the different purposes of fishtank filters. Really excellent metaphor üêü that gets away from the 'sizes of testing' trope.‚Äù
