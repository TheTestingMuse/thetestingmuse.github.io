## What is a Speaker Rider?

A Speaker Rider is a set of requests or demands that form part of a _performance contract_ put together and signed by a performance artist (often a celebrity) and an event promoter. It outlines the criteria agreed upon in order to put on a performance.

Its primary purpose is to make sure the artist is properly provided for during the event and during travel.

You've probably heard of some of the demands in them:

- A life-sized cardboard cutout of himself (David Hasselhoff)
- 16oz bottles of Evian water only, unless the water is for tea, in which case is must be Poland Spring (Mariah Carey)
- A framed portrait of Princess Diana (Britney Spears)

This one is based on the excellent move [@FriendlyTester](https://twitter.com/FriendlyTester) made in creating one for this same purpose.

## So, why do I need one?

My Rider is far less extravagant than some of those above, and frankly it has a purpose - To do the right thing!

It does this via several simple requirements:

1. A _diverse and inclusive_ line-up of speakers
2. A _code of conduct_, for speaker security
3. Not "pay to speak"
4. Max attendance limits
5. Fees for things that take a lot of time or effort

## The Rider

### Diversity, Inclusion & Equity

**An event will have a minimum of 30% gender-diverse speakers**
**An event will have several speakers from ethnic minorities**
**An event will have at least one first time speaker**

I'm passionate about Diversity, Inclusion and Equity, and I want to play my part in shifting the focus onto folks who should _already_ have that focus anyway, but don't!

Please read these excellent resources:

- [The Tech She Can Charter - PwC UK](https://www.pwc.co.uk/who-we-are/women-in-technology/tech-she-can-charter.html)
- [Black Girls Code](https://www.blackgirlscode.com/)
- [Diversity in Tech - Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in Technology](https://www.diversityintech.co.uk/)

### Code of Conduct

**An event will have a documented Code of Conduct**

This will be published online for all potential attendees, and distributed to attendees who have booked tickets. It will detail the expectations of attendees, and how folks can seek help if needed.

### Not "pay to speak"

**An event will cover travel costs (flights, taxis, buses, trains, ferries) and accommodation for ALL speakers**

If an event leaves a speaker out of pocket in any way, it is a "pay to speak" conference. That could be anything from not covering taxis to the airport, not providing meals etc right up to not paying for flights/accommodation.

Speakers spent a lot of time and effort in creating quality talks and workshops, which an event will profit from - It's only fair that you cover any costs when they are asked to speak for you.

### Max attendance limits

**The number of attendees in a workshop or tutorial is decided by me**

When it comes to understanding the maximum number of attendees at a workshop or tutorial _in order to still provide them with a valuable time_, I understand my course better than anybody else. I'll know how many people should be the maximum for the event and we can discuss that before any contracts are signed be on the same page.

### Fees for effort

**An event will offer remuneration for workshops, tutorials and keynotes**

Higher profile engagements like Keynotes, or more labour-intensive sessions like Workshops or Tutorials naturally take a _lot_ more preparation time.

#### Keynotes

A Keynote is a high-profile and impactful piece of work. There is a lot of preparation work, slide design and content, practice, timing and adjustment to deliver the result you want.

My Keynote fee is £200, plus travel and accommodation (see: Not "pay to speak")

#### Workshops

A Workshop can be anything from 99 minutes up to an entire day.

In order to keep delegates engaged and focused, more preparation needs to be spent on content, activities and learning, to ensure that they walk away having seen the value in the workshop and how they might apply their learnings.

My workshop fee is a minimum of £500 for half a day, plus travel and accommodation (see: Not "pay to speak")

#### Tutorials

For a tutorial the fee is a minimum of £2500, however, this will vary depending on the fees being charged by your event.

### Virtual Talks

If your conference is now _virtual_, but you are still charging for attendance, I still expect all speakers to still be remunerated according to their session.
