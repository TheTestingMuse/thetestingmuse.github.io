A short while ago I did a mini talk called "Quality is Pointless!" - This is the blog post related to that mini talk.
- ---
I will be covering three topics today:
1. **What is Quality?**
2. When does quality **Matter**?
3. When is quality **Pointless**?

## Point 1 - **What is Quality?**

Quality is:
- **Value to some person** - It improves somebody‚Äôs life, somehow
- **Usefulness** - It serves a purpose and helps somebody
- **Correctness** - It does what we expect it to do
- **Goodness** - It‚Äôs enjoyable, or pleasant for the user

## Point 2 - When does Quality **matter?**

This is an easy one - Pretty. Much. Always!

Of course there are also contexts where quality is **less of a concern**, and even times when **Quality is Pointless***

**Let me explain** by using an **imaginary story** about a **real product**...

> Disclaimer: The names and story are fabricated!

## Steve
Let's imagine an entrepreneur named **Steve**

Steve has an **amazing idea**

He‚Äôs sure it **will make millions**

Like all good entrepreneurs, he thrashes-out **lots of questions** to understand the **viability of his product**
- Do we have the right people and skills to deliver this?
- Who are our competitors?
- What are the Risks?
- What does 'good' look like?
- How can we do this with a backbone of Quality?
- What is our timescale?
- What budget do we have?
- How will we measure success?
- etc

He **evaluates his market competition** to understand how he might compete and satisfied with the plan, the project is ready to go!

Like **all good projects** he collaborates and gets his team together
- Sponsor
- Product
- Design
- Engineering
- Quality

They set about discussing the project:
- The **plan**
- The **risks**
- The **work items**
- How they might be **developed**
- How they might be **tested**
- How they might be **delivered**

A few months later and v1.0 the product is ready.

From **ideation** to **creation** of the product to the **delivery** of it, **Everyone** is thrilled with what they‚Äôve produced. Bravo, team, bravo!

They ship the product to stores, but there‚Äôs **hardly any interest** from customers.

So they **build more features** into a v2

And **even more features** into a v3

They ship v3 to stores but there's **still no interest!**

They **re-evaluate the competition** and are **happy to be leading the way**

They build **yet MORE features** into v4

And **MOORRREE** features into v5

They ship v5 to stores and nothing! **Barely interest!**

But the **Quality is AMAZING!**

They decide **they want direct customer feedback** on the product, but as there haven't been enough purchases to get decent feedback, **they give the product away for free** and gather the feedback:
- This smart salt shaker has voice controls, but can't grind salt...
- Oh no, they made a salt shaker that connects to music. Yes, it plays music while you shake salt...
- This salt shaker is more ridiculous than Juicero...
- What did salt do to deserve a bluetooth-connected shaker?

**Oh dear!**

All that **time**

All that **effort**

All that **money spent on developing the product**

And **Such. Good. Quality.**

**THIS is when Quality is Pointless!**

## Let‚Äôs rewind right the way back...

Steve thrashed-out **lots of questions** initially to understand the **viability of his product**
- Do we have the right people and skills?
- Who are our competitors?
- What are the Risks?
- What does 'good' look like?
- How can we do this with a backbone of Quality?
- What is our timescale?
- What budget do we have?
- How will we measure success?
- etc

**What‚Äôs missing?**

> He didn't try to get to the bottom of the **Value** of the product!

He didn't ask **Why** they were doing this?

Or **What problem** are they solving?

Or **What metrics and data is driving this initiative**?

These types of question help us to decide whether there‚Äôs **Value** in the work to be done **BEFORE we do it!**

**High Quality is Pointless in products with no Value**

It‚Äôs a **waste of time, effort, AND money**

**Try to understand you product‚Äôs potential value**

If you can't, ask around and learn about the context of the work

When you understand the value, THEN **Fit your quality strategy to it:**
- If it‚Äôs a **gut feel** or **hunch** or has **no metrics**, try to drive the focus on **GETTING** metrics ASAP
- If there‚Äôs a **wealth of metrics** driving the decision to build it, **THEN** focus on quality.

It is 100% within a Quality professional's remit to help the business and teams think about the work, the value and how we create it with high quality, when high quality makes sense.

Oh, and yes, the bluetooth-connected musical salt shaker that doesn't grind salt is a real product... ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
